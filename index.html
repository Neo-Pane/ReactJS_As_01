              Welcome to the MDN learning area. This set of articles aims to
              guide complete beginners to web development with all that they
              need to start coding websites.

              The aim of this area of MDN is not to take you from "beginner" to
              "expert" but to take you from "beginner" to "comfortable." From
              there, you should be able to start making your way, learning from
              <a href="#"> the rest of MDN </a>, and other intermediate to
              advanced resources that assume a lot of previous knowledge.

              If you are a complete beginner, web development can be challenging
              : we will hold your hand and provide enough detail for you to feel
              comfortable and learn the topics properly. You should feel at home
              whether you are a student learning web development (on your own or
              as part of a class), a teacher looking for class materials, a
              hobbyist, or someone who just wants to understand more about how
              web technologies work
